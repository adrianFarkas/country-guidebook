                Education in Hungary is predominantly public, run by the Ministry of Human Resources. Preschool
                kindergarten education is compulsory and provided for all children between three and six years old,
                after which school attendance is also compulsory until age of sixteen.[1] Primary education usually
                lasts for eight years. Secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on
                different academic levels: the Gymnasium enrols the most gifted children and prepares students for
                university studies; the secondary vocational schools for intermediate students lasts four years and the
                technical school prepares pupils for vocational education and the world of work. The system is partly
                flexible and bridges exist, graduates from a vocational school can achieve a two years program to have
                access to vocational higher education for instance.[2] The Trends in International Mathematics and
                Science Study (TIMSS) rated 13–14-year-old pupils in Hungary among the bests in the world for maths and
                science. Most of the Hungarian universities are public institutions, and students traditionally study
                without fee payment. The general requirement for university is the Matura. The Hungarian public higher
                education system includes universities and other higher education institutes, that provide both
                education curricula and related degrees up to doctoral degree and also contribute to research
                activities. Health insurance for students is free until the end of their studies. English and German
                language is important in Hungarian higher education, there are a number of degree programs that are
                taught in these languages, which attracts thousands of exchange students every year. Hungary's higher
                education and training has been ranked 44 out of 148 countries in the Global competitiveness Report
                2014.

                Today there are 67 higher education institutions in Hungary, ranging from small colleges to top research
                universities. These universities and colleges are maintained either by the state, private organizations
                or a church. In accordance with the objectives of the Bologna process the degree structure of tertiary
                education is based on three cycles. Nearly all study fields lead first to a Bachelor’s degree (usually 3
                years), and after a further study period to a Master’s degree (2 years). However, there are some
                exceptions: medicine, pharmacy, dental and veterinary studies, architecture, law, teacher training, and
                certain arts-, crafts- and design-related study programmes, which retain a long single-cycle structure
                of 5 or 6 years of study. The first-cycle programmes last 6–8 semesters (3–4 years, 180–240 credit
                points) and lead to a bachelor's degree (in Hungarian: alapfokozat). The second cycle, leading to a
                master's degree (in Hungarian: mesterfokozat), lasts 2–4 semesters (1–2 years, 60–120 credit points).
                Two-year-long vocational higher education programmes (in Hungarian: felsőoktatási szakképzés) are also
                available on an optional basis prior to first-cycle programmes and lead to advanced vocational
                qualifications. The 120 credit points gained in vocational higher education programmes are compatible
                for recognition in the first (Bachelor) cycle. Any Bachelor’s or master's degree can be followed by
                specialised higher education courses (in Hungarian: szakirányú továbbképzés). These do not lead to
                another degree but offer the option of specialisation in a particular field of study. Courses can be
                studied full-time, part-time or through distance learning. A four-year doctoral programme is a
                post-graduate course to follow any Master’s or equivalent qualification. Hungary has a long tradition of
                higher education reflecting the existence of established knowledge
                economy. The established universities in Hungary include some of the oldest in the world, the first was
                the University of Pécs founded in 1367 which is still functioning, although in the year 1276, the
                university of Veszprém was destroyed by the troops of Peter Csák, but it was never rebuilt. Sigismund
                established Óbuda University in 1395. Another, Universitas Istropolitana, was established 1465 in
                Pozsony by Mattias Corvinus. Nagyszombat University was founded in 1635 and moved to Buda in 1777 and it
                is called Eötvös Loránd University today. The world's first institute of technology was founded in
                Selmecbánya, Kingdom of Hungary in 1735, its legal successor is the University of Miskolc. The Budapest
                University of Technology and Economics is considered the oldest institute of technology in the world
                with university rank and structure, its legal predecessor the Institutum Geometrico-Hydrotechnicum was
                founded in 1782 by Emperor Joseph II.
