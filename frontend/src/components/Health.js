                Állami Szívkórház ("State Heart Hospital") in Balatonfüred, resort town by Lake Balaton Hungary has a
                tax-funded universal healthcare system, organized by the state-owned National Health Insurance Fund
                (Hungarian: Országos Egészségbiztosítási Pénztár (OEP)). According to the OECD 100% of the total
                population is covered by universal health insurance,[1] which is absolutely free for children (all
                people under 16), mothers or fathers with baby, students, pensioners (everyone over 62), people with low
                income, handicapped people (including physical and mental disorders),[2] priests and other church
                employees.[3] Health in Hungary can be described with a rapidly increasing life expectancy (7.48 years
                for men and 4.92 years for women between 1993 and 2013)[4] and a very low infant mortality rate (4.6 per
                1,000 live births in 2014).[4] According to the OECD Hungary spent 7.8% of its GDP on health care in
                2012. Total health expenditure was 1,688.7 US$ per capita in 2011, 1,098.3 US$ governmental-fund (65%)
                and 590.4 US$ private-fund (35%).[5] Doctors' pay is the lowest from among the OECD countries. General
                practitioners are paid 1.4 times the average wage and hospital specialists 1.6 times.

                The first hospitals go back to the 13th-century mining towns of Hungary. The first mining health
                insurance was founded by János Thurzó in 1496. The first modern insurer was established in 1907, named
                Országos Munkásbetegsegélyező és Balesetbiztosító Pénztár ("National Workers' Sick-benefit and Accident
                Fund"). The first steps to overall health insurance took place in the Horthy era with the creation of
                Országos Társadalombiztosítási Intézet (lit. "National Social Insurance Institution") in 1928 (This is
                the predecessor of present-day Országos Egészségbiztosítási Pénztár.). Social services were complete to
                1938, at that time the Hungarian social health insurance system was the most progressive and charitable
                in East-Central Europe. After the World War II the Communist government fully nationalized social
                insurance. Since then the Hungarian healthcare system has been state-owned, overall and available for
                all of the people.[7] The free-market shift initiated after the end of communist rule 30 years ago put a
                strain on the largely centralised, wholly tax-funded public health system, which required far-reaching
                reforms.[8] These resulted in the creation of the National Healthcare Fund (Hungarian: Országos
                Egészségbiztosítási Pénztár), in 1993.[9] The OEP, predominantly based on a social insurance system,[8]
                is the public organization currently controlling the management of health care in Hungary.[9] 83% of the
                financing for health care comes from taxes and other public revenues.[10] Participation in the insurance
                scheme is mandatory for everyone in the workforce, including the self-employed.[11] Most private
                hospitals also operate under the OEP framework.[9] Because of past hiring policies, Hungarian hospitals
                often have redundancies of doctors, and a lack of nurses, resulting in an unproductive misuse of human
                resources.[8] So-called "gratitude payments", another communist legacy, require in practice a cash
                payment to have access to better treatments.[8] According to the survey conducted by the Euro health
                consumer index in 2015 Hungary was among the European countries in which unofficial payments to doctors
                were reported most commonly.[12] Medical treatment deemed "medically necessary" is provided free of
                charge for European citizens in the country.
